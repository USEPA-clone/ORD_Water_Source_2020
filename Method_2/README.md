## Revised Method for Estimating Water Source

This method includes the boundaries of known public water service areas.

Alterations include:

- census blocks that were classified as using private water are overidden if they are within a known service area boundary.

- In states where we have a high percentage (TBD) of service areas by population served, we can assume that census blocks outside of service areas are private

- Everything else stays the same.
