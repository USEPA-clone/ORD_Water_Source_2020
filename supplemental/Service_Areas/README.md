## Service Area Boundary Data

Community water systems, which represent any water system that serves at least 25 people or has 15 connections year-round, are regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Several states have collected or developed service area boundary data for these systems. For our analysis, we used service area boundary data from the following states:

-   California
-   Connecticut
-   New Jersey
-   Washington

We determined these data to be the most complete and accurate of the service area boundary data available. See below for descriptions of the data included. For more information on community water system service areas, see the recently developed [dataset of community water systems](https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/community-water-system-service-area-boundaries) developed by EPA, which includes both utility supplied boundaries, as well as model derived estimated boundaries.
